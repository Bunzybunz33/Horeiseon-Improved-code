Horeiseon-Improved-code

Modify a starter code

I was tasked to refactor a stater code (HTML & CSS file).
I built this project to practice my skills in using the coorect emelemnts in HTML and CSS.
I leant that having a nice stuctured code is easy to follow and is easy for other to follow.

Installation
Open Git Terminal
use command Git CLone <https://github.com/Bunzybunz33/Horeiseon-Improved-code.git>
folder should now be on ypur local machine.

Thank you !
